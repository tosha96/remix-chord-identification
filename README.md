remix-chord-identification
==========================

**This project is old, it and it's required echonest API may not be functional anymore.**

Created as part of the Denver Music Hack Day.

A python program making use of the EchoNest Remix API to detect key/chords within the song, and create chord and song structures

Currently chord identification only works for the I root chord, however other chords and chord/song structures can still be built.

(GUI interface was created using the EasyGUI library)
